const puzzle = `Four people need to cross a river at night. They have only one flashlight, and at most two people can cross at a time. They all move at different speeds:

Person A can cross the river in 1 minute.
Person B can cross the river in 2 minutes.
Person C can cross the river in 5 minutes.
Person D can cross the river in 10 minutes.
When two people cross together, they must move at the slower personâ€™s pace. The flashlight must be carried back and forth; it cannot be thrown or sent back on its own.

Question:
What is the shortest time in which all four people can get across the river?`
